    <h1>Presenting and Critiquing Design</h1>
    <p>
        I am interested in presenting and critiquing design topics, my major is media and information, and I concentration on filmmaking. 
        Presenting designs is the same thing as how we learn to pitch our ideas in the film to the investors. I believe that a good 
        design needs a great presenting to support just like a good film idea. From the article attached, there are three great bullet 
        points that could be used in presenting and critiquing design: Use a well-designed presentation template; Have one focal point 
        per slide. Practice going through your presentation once or twice. A great presentation wont have too much text on the screen 
        and should focus on the design itself and the passion the speaker has. If there are multiple points really want to mention 
        specially, put one on each slide and introduce them well, that way it wont be a mess on the screen and the audience would also 
        be focusing on the presentation.
